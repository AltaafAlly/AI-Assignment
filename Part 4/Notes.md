#Stuff we did to our bot so far

- Need to make baseline better to beat RandomBot and TroutBot 
- Baseline sensing must be random but moves must not 
- Improved only needs to improved from sensing 


- # Stuff to take into account for improve and report
- Look at choose_move and how our bot makes moves 
- Look at how our bot senses in the ImprovedBot under the choose_sense function in comparison to the         RandomSenseBot
- Look at patterns on how our Improved wins compared to the RandomSenseBot and see how the improvement occurs
- Look at time of matches also
